🌈For anyone that might be wondering, "Lunfer" is an alias I've been using for quite some time, here in the online world <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it's made out of two "sub-names" that have a direct connection with my real name, Zoi. (obviously it's something <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've made when I was quite young but at least it's not something to be ashamed of!)
